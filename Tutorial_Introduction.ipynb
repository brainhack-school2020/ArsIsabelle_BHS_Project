You are most likely already familiar with the __Requirements.txt__ and __Setup.md__ files as you had to read them to get to this notebook. They are simply text files with instructions: [Requirements.txt](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/ArsIsabelle_BHS_Project/blob/master/Requirements.txt) for software to install on your computer and [Setup.md](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/ArsIsabelle_BHS_Project/blob/master/Setup.md) to set these tools to use the notebooks of this tutorial.     \n",

Note that '.md' stands for 'Markdown, which is a format of text file in which you can integrate multiple components (images, url, etc.) by using [specific synthax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you may have alrady noticed, cells in Markdown mode in jupyter notebooks (such as this one) use this syntax as well!  \n",

    "#### FFRclassifiers Folder\n",
    "The folder named __['FFRclassifiers'](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/ArsIsabelle_BHS_Project/tree/master/FFRclassifiers)__ contains the machine-learning MATLAB scripts and functions. You can run them directly in MATLAB (by downloading the folder 'FFRCLassifiers' on your local computer) or within the jupyter notebook [Matlab_HMM_Scripts_Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/ArsIsabelle_BHS_Project/Matlab_HMM_Scripts_Notebook.ipynb). You may notice that this folder contains more than one classifiers. Under the BHS Project, I focused on the HMM, but the structure of the classifiers was developped such that the HMM, the SVM and the x-correlation can all use the same input folder for the data. There is also two versions of the HMM. The integration of the second HMM, SVM, X-Correlation and SLTM classifiers will continue after the BHS project. \n",

    "#### Workflow Document\n",
    "__Procedures_Workflow.md__ is a summary of the Classifiers Workflow. It contains information to run the stand-alone scripts directly in MATLAB. It is short and sweet, and simply get the job done. It is currently a .md file but a pdf version will also be made available.\n",

    "__License__ is the open source MIT License for the Tutorial and ML scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data and Data Archiving\n",
    "The __Data__ used in the HMM tutorial has been already integrated in the classifiers structure (In the FFRs and Input1 folders). This was possible because each EEG-FFR data file was below the 100 MB limit autorized by Git Hub. This data was generously provided by Emily Coffey and Robert Zatorre from McGill University. As behavioral data (and fMRI) data is also associated with this data collection, it will grow in size. Thus, the dataset was loaded on the __Open Science Framework__ which is linked to the Git repository ArsIsabelle_BHS_Project. However, as our project with this data is not completed yet, the OSF entry is currently set on private mode. At the moment, you may access the OSF page in read-only mode, for your convenience, [here](https://osf.io/c2b3t/?view_only=d1b30d4e0e7c4d53a8ec80d4d87b33d2). Once ready, we aim to share the data and the extended machine-learning tutorials with the scientific community.  \n",

    "\n",
    "##### Note on Using the HMM With Other Dataset:\n",
    "Feel free to use your own dataset with this tutorial. Information on the FFR-EEG format can be found in README.md. file. If you go with this route, make sure to also adjust the setup.m file as the number of trials and other features of the data are customized for this specific dataset in this script.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Components and Additions\n",
    "As this project is quite extended, it will continue to expend (e.g. integration of BIDS-format, other classifiers, tutorials to adjust parameters, adding more fun images, etc). An FFR project from the Zatorre Lab and collaborators will use it. Thus, Components not listed here might be added.
