You have TWO options to run the Machine-Learning (ML) classifiers:

STAND-ALONE SCRIPTS:

If you can't/don't want to use the jupyter notebook, you can run the classifiers scripts directly in MATLAB. 
1) Make sure to download the whole folder called 'Classifiers' to preserve the structure of the scripts and functions. 
2) On your local computer terminal, go to the directory where you downloded the classifiers' folder and start MATLAB. 
3) Make sure to follow the steps provided in the file "Instructions_SA_Scripts" for instructions on the Machine-Learning Procedures.     

JUPYTER NOTEBOOK:

The Jupyter Notebook requires the installation of a virtual environment adapted to MATLAB. 
1) Make sure to follow the instructions described on this web page:
https://am111.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jmatlab_install.html 
2) Be careful, the command 'pip install matlab_kernal' contains a typo, it should be 'pip install matlab_kernel'
Correct it, when entering this command in your local terminal 

If you are comfortable with github environment, you can also find the instructions (withou the typo) on the following repository:
